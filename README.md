# Understanding blockchain by creating a blockchain in JavaScript

One Paragraph of project description goes here

### Block

Defining what a block in a blockchain looks like by creating class called Block.
Constructor for class Block receives properties:
- index - where the blocks sits on the chain (optional)
- timestamp - when the block was created
- data - e.g. details for transactions (how much money was transfered, how was the sender and receiver)
- previous hash - string that contains the hash of the block before the current one. It ensures integrity of the blockchain (empty string by default)

```javascript
class Block {
  constructor (index, timestamp, data, previousHash = '') {
    this.index = index;
    this.timestamp = timestamp;
    this.data = data;
    this.previousHash = previousHash;
    this.hash = this.calculateHash();
  }
}
```
What is the .calculateHash() method?


```javascript
  calculateHash() {
    return SHA256(this.index + this.previousHash + this.timestamp + JSON.stringify(this.data) + this.nonce).toString();
  }
```
